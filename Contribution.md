Future Scope:

As the proposed system currently runs on a Desktop version, we would also implement it for Android and IOS devices to provide ease of access and usability to our customers. Recently, the Recommender system is the most important research area with the advent of e-commerce and e-business on the web. Many types of research are being conducted to improve the music recommendation to users based on their emotions. Removing popularity bias from the recommended songs. Lastly, we would like to integrate blockchain into this system to make it more beneficial for the artists and the listeners alike, economically.
